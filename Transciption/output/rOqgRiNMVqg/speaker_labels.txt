Speaker A: So does the SEC meaning secure and govern growth and Data Science meaning applied ML, ML Ops and Anti Abuse team meeting. That's a big mouthful. We might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APAC and hi Alan, glad you're here. Why are you here? When it's midnight we can talk. Glad you're here. Don't make it a habit to come to this meeting since it's really late for you so. But I'm glad. Thanks for coming at least once. So, news and events. I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this so apologies for that but I think it's going to go down over time based on feedback. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal to noise ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This was wrote in for this group adding more items to our staff meeting agenda often as re only rather than posting to our Slack channel. And I am going to be assuming that people leaders on the team will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the Slack channel. So keep that in mind. B is a read only item unless anybody wants to discuss it and see Phil has.
Speaker B: Hi, welcome Alan to the to the meeting. I've asked Alan to step in as acting full Stack Manager for Security Policies while I hire an em. Alan has graciously accepted this this wonderful opportunity. So welcome Alan. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. So Anti Abuse is moving product sections from SEC to Data Science. Data Science is effectively a rename of the Model Ops section. So Data Science will include two stages. The existing Model Ops which has three groups in it which Muln can talk more about, and the Anti Abuse stage which only currently has one group which is called Anti Abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split Anti Abuse into two groups, but that's not in the near term and we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of workday changes, lots of handbook changes. Mon, did you want to say anything more about Data Science or Model Ops?
Speaker C: No, I think for us we just roll up to Data Science. Everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups applied ML, MLOps and then later data ops as part of it. Yeah.
Speaker A: So thanks Thomas for continuing to compile and report on across all of my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meeting on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So really do appreciate that.
Speaker D: Gotta give Neil. A high five too. He does. He does half of these now and. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for. What's the story behind what's going on with reliability or secure or. Or error. Budget stuff. Just trying to provide air cover and I.
