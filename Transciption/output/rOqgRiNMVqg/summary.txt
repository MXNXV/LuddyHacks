- So does the SEC meaning secure and govern growth and Data Science meaning applied ML, ML Ops and Anti Abuse team meeting. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APAC. Thanks for coming at least once.
- For FedRamp, you're looking at any FIPS related security issues that have been raised. How far are you going in terms of auditing to find anything that hasn't already been identified? Nikhil George is our stable counterpart of Folks don't know, at least in sec. He is also helping chase down answers.
- New approval rules on segregation of duties. Has this had an impact, these new approval rules? Anecdotally, I've seen a few cases where team members have realized that they need to get an additional approval. But I'm not aware that it's actually slowing things down.
- GitLab is looking for a new name for the Sec Growth and Data Science team. Naming things is really important at GitLab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. I landed on enrichment because what we do makes other things better. Not sure we'll change the name.
- I would like to add announcements of work anniversaries and new hires to the meeting template. We don't celebrate enough for team cohesion, team celebration across the board. Maybe also a thanks or praise section. Don't create busy work for yourself either.
- Olivier has popped back on slack to announce that the newest addition to their family is here and happened over the weekend. And we'll be hoping to celebrate him later when he does, when he. returns to work Google. Have a great day.
