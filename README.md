## üìã Project Overview

Service WOW addresses the challenge of efficiently collecting, evaluating, and prioritizing innovation ideas within organizations. Our platform uses AI to automate the scoring process, allowing teams to focus on implementation rather than lengthy manual evaluation cycles.

### üéØ Key Objectives

- Streamline the innovation collection process
- Provide objective, AI-driven evaluation of ideas
- Enable data-driven decision making through visual analytics
- Facilitate collaboration through voting and feedback mechanisms
- Reduce the time from idea submission to implementation decision

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*AI-Driven Evaluation*: Each submitted idea is auto-scored for ROI, Effort, Strategic Alignment, and Risk using Google Gemini, including plain-language justifications and a composite score.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Data Dashboard*: Visual dashboards show:
  - ROI vs Effort with vote-based bubble sizes
  - Top ideas by score
  - Category-based analysis
  - Priority rankings and filters
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Meeting Intelligence*: Upload ‚Å† .mp3 ‚Å†, ‚Å† .wav ‚Å†, or ‚Å† .mp4 ‚Å† files to extract:
  - Smart summaries

## üîÅ How the System Works (Interval Breakdown)

| Step | Component | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | User submits a new idea via UI | Stored in Firestore ‚Å† ideas_input ‚Å† collection |
| 2 | Cloud Function triggers (‚Å† evaluate_idea ‚Å†) | Sends data to Gemini via structured ReAct-style prompt |
| 3 | Gemini returns enriched idea with scores and reasoning |
| 4 | Result saved to Firestore ‚Å† ideas_output ‚Å† collection |
| 5 | Frontend reads ‚Å† ideas_output ‚Å† for visualization in list and dashboard |
| 6 | User uploads meetings (optional) for analysis and summary |

    ‚Å†Typical end-to-end turnaround for AI scoring: *< 10 seconds*
